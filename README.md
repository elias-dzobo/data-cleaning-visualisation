# Data Cleaning and Visualisation

This repository contains an exercise for gaining hands-on experience with real-world data preprocessing and visualization. The objective is to understand the challenges involved in cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data to extract valuable insights. This exercise will provide an opportunity to apply various techniques and tools commonly used in data preprocessing and visualization workflows.

## Objectives

1. Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers. This step ensures the data is reliable and suitable for analysis.
2. Data Transformation: Apply data transformation techniques such as feature scaling, normalization, or encoding categorical variables. This step prepares the data for further analysis and modeling.
3. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to explore the data and uncover patterns, relationships, or trends. Use various plotting libraries and techniques to present the data in a meaningful and insightful way.
4. Insights and Interpretation: Analyze the visualizations and derive meaningful insights from the data. Interpret the patterns or trends observed and draw conclusions that can inform decision-making or further analysis.
Steps to Achieve the Objectives

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:
bash

git clone <repository_url>

Prepare the Data: Download or access the dataset for this exercise. Ensure that the dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel) and stored in the appropriate location within the project structure.
Data Cleaning: Implement data cleaning tasks as necessary. This may include handling missing values, dealing with duplicates, and addressing outliers. Refer to the provided exercise instructions or guidelines for specific requirements.
Data Transformation: Apply appropriate data transformation techniques based on the characteristics of the dataset. This may involve scaling numerical features, normalizing values, or encoding categorical variables. Use relevant libraries or functions for these transformations.
Data Visualization: Utilize data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create visual representations of the data. Explore various types of plots such as scatter plots, bar charts, line plots, or heatmaps to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
Insights and Interpretation: Analyze the generated visualizations and extract meaningful insights from the data. Identify key trends, patterns, or relationships that can provide valuable information or support decision-making. Document your findings and interpretations.
Documentation: Update the README.md file with a summary of the exercise, steps followed, and any relevant observations or insights. Include necessary details about the dataset, tools used, and key findings.
Commit and Push: Commit your changes to the local repository and push them to the remote repository on GitHub. Use appropriate commit messages to describe the modifications made.
Review and Feedback: If applicable, share your code and visualizations with others for review and feedback. Incorporate any suggested improvements or changes to enhance the analysis or presentation.
By following these steps, you will gain practical experience in data preprocessing and visualization, which will contribute to a better understanding of real-world data challenges and insights extraction.
